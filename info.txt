easy deploy
rest api
launch computations
retrieve result


OAServer
 - init (up and running)
 - register (ready for computation)
 - state
 - compute
 - delete


tuto
 - test with python script
 - test with workflow, need workflow package up and running

What about provenance??

oaserver package (create package of current virtualenv for future deploy)
use tuto to deploy the archive on remote machine
oaserver launch (launch server, option type, url?)

make communication more general i.e. scifloware agnostic
